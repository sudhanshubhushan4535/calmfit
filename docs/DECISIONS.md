# Decisions

Product questions the build spec doesn't answer. Each one takes the most conservative option;
revisit any of them by changing the code, tests and this file together.

## Day 3

### D1. Can "do later" move an exercise that already has logged sets?
- **Choice:** Yes. It only changes the order within today's workout.
- **Why:** Order has no effect on plans, sets or progression, so blocking it would protect nothing.

### D2. How is the new order stored?
- **Choice:** The moved exercise gets `max(position) + 1`, so positions can have gaps
  (the `0-based` comment in migration 00009 describes the initial order only).
- **Why:** Reads only `ORDER BY position`. Moving one row can't collide with the non-deferrable
  `UNIQUE (workout_id, position)`, and other rows are never rewritten.
